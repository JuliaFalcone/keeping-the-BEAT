Welcome to the BEAT documentation!
===================================


The Bayesian Evidence Analysis Tool (BEAT) is a Python-based code for measuring and dissecting multi-component emission lines. BEAT was designed to analyze large numbers of spectra (i.e. large surveys or IFU spectroscopy) automatically and determine the number of physical kinematic components in a given set of emission lines. BEAT utilizes the MultiNest sampling algorithm to compute Bayesian statistics and determine the number of components for each fit.

In-depth descriptions of BEAT can be found in the following papers: Fischer et al. 2017 (see the Appendix), Falcone et al. 2024 (see Section 3).
