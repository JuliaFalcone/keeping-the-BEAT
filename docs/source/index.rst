The Bayesian Evidence Analysis Tool (BEAT) is a Python-based code for measuring
and dissecting multi-component emission lines frequently observed in active
galactic nuclei (AGN) exhibiting outflowing winds. BEAT was designed to analyze
large numbers of spectra (i.e. large surveys or IFU spectroscopy) automatically
and determine the number of physical kinematic components in a given set of
emission lines.
